# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

There are three main prerequisites for installing Catln:

- [Haskell GHC comiler](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/distribution_packages.html)
- [Haskell Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade/), to build the compiler and manage Haskell dependencies.
- LLVM 8 which can be installed through a package manager such as `brew install llvm@8` or `apt install llvm-8`

## Installation

To install the Catln compiler, begin by checking out the Catln repository. I will refer to this directory as `$CATLN_HOME`. Then, you can install it by running:

```bash
cd $CATLN_HOME
stack install
mkdir -p ~/.catln
ln -s $CATLN_HOME/stack ~/.catln/stack
```

This installs Catln to `~/.local/bin/catln`. You may have to add `~/.local/bin` to your path in order to run catln.

It also sets up your home directory to reference the installed catln stack, to find core libraries and packages.

You can determine the available options for catln by running `catln --help`.

If you want to run the docs, you will also need to build the docs site as well. Install `npm` and then run the following:

```
cd $CATLN_HOME/webdocs
npm install
npm run build
```

## Running

Now that it is installed, the compiler should be available in your path. You can test this by running `catln --help`.

There are several subcommands available within the compiler.

You can use `catln run FILEPATH [FUN]` to run a particular file. It will expect to find a definition of `[FUN]` within that file to run. Passing `[FUN]` is optional and the default is the function named `main`. This command must be run from the directory of `$CATLN_HOME`.

You can use `catln build FILEPATH [FUN]` to build a particular file. It will expect to find a definition of `[FUN]` within that file defining what to build. Passing `[FUN]` is optional and the default is the function named `main`. This command must be run from the directory of `$CATLN_HOME`.

You can use `catln doc PATH` to run the doc server on port `8080`. It will serve all `.ct` files located recursively in the `PATH` if it is a directory, or just `PATH` if not. It will also include all dependencies in the doc build. This command must be run from the directory of `$CATLN_HOME` and requires some additional installation (see above).

There are also several additional options to run in the [building for development document](contrib/building.md).
