# Tests using the context
  It requires using the type of the input argument as the output type of id as well.
  So, it must be read as `id($T) -> $T`, not (id(Any) -> Any).

data(Counter(i -> Integer))

inc{c= Counter(i)}= (){Counter(i + 1)}

count{c= Counter(i)}= i{Counter(i)}

main{io -> IO} =
  _<- (){Counter(0)}
  _<- inc{}
  io.exit(val= 0)
